Every week/Bi weekly
Week I: I post a vlog, content is 1. Me sharing a personal story and then 2. Connecting the story to a positive psychology info piece. 3. Ending the vlog with an open ended question calling others to share a story with the prompted specific theme.


Between week I and week II other people post videos with their own stories that connect with my prompt.


Week II: I feature a selected video of 1. One of the video 2esponse stories, and 2. I point out an element in their story which I then connect with a Positive Psychology info piece. 3. Ending the vlog with an open ended question calling others to share a story with a specific theme.


Between week II and week III other people post videos with their own stories that connect with my prompt.


And so on, and so forth…

Popularity plan:
I actively pursue friends and colleagues to post a story for me, hoping to get some Harvard professors to share and some celebrities too. Slowly spread the word to other famous personas. Summer comes I take the initiative to lead a student group and invite celebrities for events, or simply join one of the student groups so I get a budget and invite celebrities to speak of their journey and share a story, which I can later feature too!


Website Programing Logistics:


* Ability to post video LINKS (from vimeo, youtube,facebook, vine, etc). 
* Links to positive psychology sources
* Scroll down locations to videos ordered by date (endless amount of scrolling for however videos may come in the future)
* A search link for videos by: lenght/popularity/date (/views)(Perhaps youtube will be the only spot for the video posts)
* [this one is not a must] A search link for videos by subject
